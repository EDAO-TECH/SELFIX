📂 SELFIX Repository Structure
Welcome to the SELFIX source code — the first decentralized ethical antivirus powered by programmable trust logic and karmic governance.

This document maps the folder structure and explains what each directory is for, how it contributes to the overall system, and what developers need to know.

📌 Top-Level Directory Layout
Directory	Purpose
core/	Core healing loop, watchdog, engine, and soul logic. This is the heartbeat of SELFIX.
api/	Exposes API interfaces (e.g. FastAPI) to wrap internal logic and support future web dashboards and remote control.
gui/	Python GUI interface and .spec for packaging into macOS .app and Windows .exe.
scripts/	Operational scripts, automation tools, CI helpers, vault checkers, seed agents, CLI wrappers, and cronable schedulers.
setup/	Build and install configurations (e.g. setup.py, install.sh) for easy deployment across platforms.
antivirus/	Signature-based scanner engine and database. Contains selfix_scanner.py and detection logs.
assets/	App icons and branding elements in .icns, .ico, .png. Used for installers and GUI display.
docs/	Whitepapers, architecture guides, customer experience docs, and product design insights.
book_of_forgiveness/	Secure healing modules — both sandboxed (_staging) and sealed (module_firewall, promoted). Includes book_manifest.json.
healing_modules/	Raw healing logic — separated into pending/ and promoted/. New logic starts here.
improvements/	Ideas backlog, experimental modules, and logic under test or staging. Organized for collaboration and sandboxing.
tests/	Karma-based test framework, module validators, and forensic tools (formerly qc).
data/	AI journal, system status snapshots, and runtime intelligence. Used by local agents.
legal_docs/	Licensed patent and DAO-verified documentation (e.g., PCT filings, WIPO proofs).
logs/	Runtime logs from daemon, healing loop, and monitors. Helpful for debugging and audits.
dist/	Build artifacts created by PyInstaller, setup scripts, etc. Auto-generated.
build/	Temporary build metadata and intermediate files. Often created by setuptools or PyInstaller.
backups/	Local or remote-synced backup scripts, snapshots, or golden archives.
inno/	Inno Setup script for building Windows .exe installers.
selfix_self_audit.py	Performs logic and configuration self-checks. Like a karma-aware checksum validator.
verify_engine.py	Scans and confirms integrity of healing logic, especially promoted modules.

🎯 Key Entry Points
File	Description
scripts/start_all.sh	Launches the healing daemon, AI monitor, scanner, and local services.
core/healing_loop.py	Main execution engine for healing events and trigger response.
antivirus/selfix_scanner.py	File-based virus scanner with JSON signature validation.
gui/selfix_gui.py	Launches the GUI interface. Used in .app or .exe builds.
scripts/selfix_monitor.py	Real-time healing dashboard monitor — logs and visualizes daemon output.

⚙️ Dev Notes
Healing Modules Flow:

Start in healing_modules/pending/

Once tested: move to book_of_forgiveness/_staging/

After successful promotion + manifest update → sealed into book_of_forgiveness/module_firewall/

Signature Engine:

selfix_signatures.json holds SHA256 hashes

Scans use both static and behavior-based flags

Updates are automated via update_signatures.sh (coming soon!)

Vault Management:

scripts/vault/ contains all secure logic archivers

Only signed and approved modules get promoted to the healing vault

Installer Notes:

macOS: see .github/workflows/build-macos-app.yml

Windows: use inno/SELFIX-setup.iss

🧠 Future Plans
Modular plugin system for healing logic

Live healing telemetry on the GUI dashboard

DAO-controlled karma rules update pipeline

Auto-sync to Selfix Seeder Network (via scripts/seeder/)

🤝 Contributions
All contributions must:

Follow karma validation in tests/qc/

Use proper filenames and metadata

Pass all pre-promotion sanity checks

Be signed if destined for the book_of_forgiveness/module_firewall/ or promoted/
